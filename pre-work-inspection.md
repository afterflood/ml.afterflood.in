When appliances are flooded, they can rarely be saved. | Good to go |
| Are there an active roof leak or other damage that would let water into the house? | Cover the damages area or the entire roof with a tarpaulin until it can be fixed. Ensure there must be a temporary water- and wind-tight roof before beginning the repair. If the house is insured, contact them immediately, but do not wait for the claims-adjuster to arrive. Before removing wet and moldy materials, take photographs for insurance purposes.Assume that building interiors are seriously contaminated with mold if:If the building was wet or under water for more than 48 hours.You see more mold growth than what was present before the flood.You see signs of water damage or mold or smell  of strong mold |  **** |
