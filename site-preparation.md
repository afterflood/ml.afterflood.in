# SITE PREPARATION

## Set up a safety and cleanup area

Set up a safety and cleanup area outside the home that includes:

* First aid kit
* Fire extinguisher 
* Cleanup buckets
* Eye wash station 
* List of emergency phone numbers
* Drinking water

Use the cleanup area as a place to wash up before taking a break. In hot weather, take breaks every hour to avoid dehydration and heat exhaustion. Have bottled water on-site and drink it regularly. Use the area to treat minor accidents, such as cuts and punctures.

## **Put on your personal protection equipment \(PPE\)**

Put on your personal protective equipment â€“ PPE \(coveralls, boots, gloves, respirators, eye protection and head protection\). Have partners, if possible, help you in and out of your coveralls and help you adjust your respirators. Check to make sure the respirator is working. Cover the with your hands and at- tempt to inhale; the respirator is working if no air enters. Keep all of your PPE on when in the home.
