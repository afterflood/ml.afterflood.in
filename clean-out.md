# CLEAN-OUT

**CLEAN-OUT**

If you are saving items, move them to the restoration area as you work.

**Air out**

 If building has not been open most of the windows and doors and leave for at least half an hour before beginning work. Remove any drapes or curtains to allow air and light to get into the home. 

**Remove small furniture and objects on floor**

 Place small items in heavy-duty trash bags to reduce the release and spread of mold spores. 

**Remove large furniture**

 Move large furniture to the curb, vernadah or courtyard if it is dry. Use dollies or wheel barrows, if available, to lessen muscle strain. When lifting, remember to lift with your legs and not your back to avoid back injuries. 

**Remove appliances**

 Tape or tie refrigerators shut before removal to avoid spilling old food containing mold and bacteria. Make sure refrigerator doors stay tied or wired shut to keep children from playing in them.

**Cut and remove wall-to-wall carpet** 

Remove wall-to-wall carpeting that is wet if you have one. Dry carpeting can remain on the floor as a “tarp” when you remove building materials from the walls and ceilings. The carpeting will protect the flooring under the carpet. Cut carpet in pieces before removing using a carpet cutting knife. 

**Clean out closets, shelves, storage areas and kitchen cabinets** 

Pots, dinnerware, buckets and other containers that are filed with flood waters need to be removed carefully. They may contain dangerous bacteria. 

Place small items in heavy-duty trash bags to reduce the release and spread of mold spores.
